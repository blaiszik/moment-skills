description: Work with Moment's context hub from any repo — orient on a project's living Brief, pull pages and resources into context, add or update pages, search and link the context graph, and close out so the next agent spins up fast. The Moment-server analog of the local-only Continuity skill. Use when the user says "/moment", "orient on Moment", "grab the project brief / project context", "pull in a page", "add a page to Moment", "search the lab", "what's the context for project N", or wants to read or enrich a Moment project without necessarily claiming a task. For the autonomous claim → do → submit task loop, use /burn instead.

# /moment — the Moment context hub

**Moment** is a **context hub**: every project carries a living **Brief** (handoff + must-read pages +
a graph of typed resources). This skill reads and writes that shared Brief — the server analog of the
local-only `continuity`. The loop: **orient → pull → enrich → close out**, no task claim required.
(For the autonomous claim → do → submit loop, use **`/burn`**.)

**Two surfaces, same capabilities.** Check which is live in one step — *don't fan out ToolSearch*: if a
`mcp__moment-research__*` tool is in your tool list, use MCP; if not, the server isn't connected — go straight
to the **`mamba run -n moment moment` CLI** (the REST API underneath; MCP and CLI are thin proxies).

> **Most tasks need only the block below.** Run it and stop. Reach for the full catalog
> (**[reference.md](reference.md)** — every tool's exact signature, all CLI flags, enums, recipes) only when
> you need a tool or flag you don't already know.

## Cold start — create a project + seed its Brief (the 90% case)

**Use `bootstrap` — one idempotent call does everything:** create (or reuse a same-title project) + opening
page + resources + handoff + note. Re-running with the same title **reuses** the project (no duplicate) and
applies the writes, so it's safe to retry. Each write returns its result — **trust it; don't `get_project_context`
afterward to "check".**

**MCP:**
```
bootstrap_project(title:"…", description:"…", domain:"AI_FOR_SCIENCE",
  page:{ title:"Design", body:"## …inline markdown…", slug:"design", agentRead:true },
  resources:[{ uri:"https://github.com/owner/repo", summary:"why it matters" }],
  handoff:{ worksNow:"…", nextStep:"…", watchOut:"…" }, note:"Seeded the Brief.")
```

**CLI (one tool call — send as a single Bash invocation):**
```bash
export MOMENT_API_KEY=…                                   # silences the "apiKey committed to git" warning
printf '## Design\n…markdown…\n' | mamba run -n moment moment --json --quiet project bootstrap \
  --title "…" --description "…" --domain AI_FOR_SCIENCE \
  --page-title "Design" --page-slug design --page-agent-read --page-body - \
  --resource https://github.com/owner/repo \
  --works-now "…" --next "…" --watch-out "…" --note "Seeded the Brief."
# domain ∈ MATERIALS_CHEMISTRY·AI_FOR_SCIENCE·HEALTH_LONGEVITY·ENERGY_CLIMATE·COMPUTATION·SYNTHETIC_BIOLOGY·QUANTUM_SYSTEMS·NEUROSCIENCE·SPACE_EXPLORATION·OTHER
```

Prefer `bootstrap` over the four separate calls (`create_project` → `upsert_page` → `add_resource` →
`log_session`) — reach for those only to enrich a project that already exists (the step-by-step sequence is in
[reference.md](reference.md)). Note the raw `create_project` has **no title dedup**, so `bootstrap` (or a
`search_context` check) is also how you avoid duplicate hubs. Linked a repo? `import_context(projectId)`
auto-seeds from the README instead of a hand-written page.

**Keep the Brief scannable:** put the real content in the **page**; the handoff and note are terse *pointers* to
it, not a third copy of the same prose.

## Ownership & access — know this before you write
- A project you create is owned by **your creator** (the user whose key you carry) — you can't set another owner.
- On your creator's projects (incl. any you just made) you have **edit access**: `upsert_page` / `add_resource`
  / `link_context` / `log_session` **apply directly**.
- Elsewhere those writes are **queued as ContextProposals** — the API returns **HTTP 202 "proposal queued"** and
  an owner must approve. A 202 (not 200/201) means you're editing a project your creator doesn't own.

## Close out — leave the Brief better than you found it
The last step of any work session (the "close out" in the loop): `log_session(N, note, handoff?)`, and promote
lasting reference material to a page (`upsert_page`, `agentRead:true` for must-know conventions/gotchas).

**Write the friction, not just the design.** The most valuable thing you leave is **what slowed you down** —
not a description of what you built. The next agent can read the diff; they can't see the footgun you already
hit. So:
- **`watchOut`** = the trap you just stepped in — a stale config, a tool that isn't what you'd assume (e.g.
  "tests are jest not vitest"), a load-bearing ordering, an API that doesn't return the field you expected.
  Concrete and specific, not "be careful."
- **`nextStep`** = the single next action, specific enough to start cold. **`worksNow` / `blockers`** = the
  state that changed.
- `note` = what you did + why, terse. Durable gotchas/conventions belong in an `agentRead` page (e.g.
  `/architecture-conventions` → its "Gotchas that cost time" section), not buried in a note that scrolls away.

> Before you close out, ask: *"what cost me time that the next agent will repeat?"* — and record THAT. A
> close-out that only restates the happy path is the most common way the Brief rots.

## Which tool when (signatures + flags → [reference.md](reference.md))
| Need | MCP | CLI |
|------|-----|-----|
| **Create + seed a project (1 call, idempotent)** | `bootstrap_project(title,description,page?,resources?,handoff?)` | `moment project bootstrap --title … --description …` |
| Read one project's Brief | `get_project_context(N)` | `moment -p N orient` |
| Survey the lab / find by meaning | `explore(q?)` · `search_context(q)` | `moment find "q"` |
| Pull an artifact / a budgeted bundle | `read_resource(N,rid)` · `compile_context(N,task)` | `moment project read-resource N rid` · `moment -p N gather "task"` |
| Add/update a page | `upsert_page(N,title,body,slug?,agentRead?)` | `moment project page N --title … --body -` |
| Attach **one whole artifact** (URL) | `add_resource(N,uri,summary?)` | `moment project add-resource N <uri>` |
| Link two nodes (typed edge) | `link_context(N,…,kind)` | — |
| Close out / refresh handoff (`watchOut` = the friction you hit, not just the design) | `log_session(N,note,handoff?)` | `moment -p N log --note … --works-now … --watch-out …` |
| Open work for others | `propose_task(N,…)` → then `/burn` | `moment project propose N …` |

**CLI gotchas:** global flags (`-p/--project`, `--json`, `--quiet`) go **before** the subcommand; `project …`
subcommands take the id **positionally**. Handoff fields (`--works-now/--watch-out/…`) live on top-level `log`,
**not** `project log`. **Resources are whole artifacts by resolvable URL** — link the repo root, not each file;
local paths (`/lustre/…`) store but won't resolve for anyone else.
