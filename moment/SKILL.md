# /moment — the Moment context hub

**Moment** is a **context hub**: every project carries a living **Brief** (handoff + must-read pages +
a graph of typed resources). This skill reads and writes that shared Brief — the server analog of the
local-only `continuity`. The loop: **orient → pull → enrich → close out**, no task claim required.
(For the autonomous claim → do → submit loop, use **`/burn`**.)

Fastest spin-up order (adapted for reading and orienting):
1. `whats_new()` — see what changed across your projects since last time.
2. `get_project_context(projectId, view: "spinup")` — a lean peek to decide whether to engage.
3. `get_project_context(projectId)` — the full brief once you commit to the project.
4. `get_task_context(taskId)` — call BEFORE claiming to preview a task's fit; after claim_task it returns the full working set.

**Two surfaces, same capabilities.** Check which is live in one step — *don't fan out ToolSearch*: if a
`mcp__moment-research__*` tool is in your tool list, use MCP; if not, the server isn't connected — go straight
to the **`mamba run -n moment moment` CLI** (the REST API underneath; MCP and CLI are thin proxies).
This in-repo copy usually targets the local dev server; external users target the cloud — see below.

> **Most tasks need only the block below.** Run it and stop. Reach for the full catalog
> (**[reference.md](reference.md)** — every tool's exact signature, all CLI flags, enums, recipes) only when
> you need a tool or flag you don't already know.

## Which Moment server — cloud or local?

There are two instances; **know which one you're talking to before any read or write**:

- **Cloud (the lab):** `https://moment-next.vercel.app` — the production instance. This is the
  default choice for anyone who did not start the server themselves.
- **Local dev:** `http://localhost:3000` (or the `apiUrl` in the repo's `.moment.json`) — only
  when you are running moment-next locally.

⚠️ **The CLI's built-in fallback is `http://localhost:3000`** — on a machine with no config it
will silently target a (probably nonexistent) local server. If you're a cloud user, set the URL
explicitly, once: `export MOMENT_API_URL=https://moment-next.vercel.app` (env), or put
`{"apiUrl": "https://moment-next.vercel.app"}` in `~/.moment.json` alongside your key.

Full resolution order (first hit wins): `--api-url` flag → repo `./.moment.json` →
`MOMENT_API_URL` env → `~/.moment.json` → localhost:3000 default. Note the repo `.moment.json`
OUTRANKS the env var — a cloned repo bound to someone's local instance will override your env;
pass `--api-url` to force. API keys are per-instance: a local dev key will not work against the
cloud and vice versa ("Invalid API key" = check the URL first, then the key).

## Cold start — create a project + seed its Brief (the 90% case)

**Use `bootstrap` — one idempotent call does everything:** create (or reuse a same-title project) + opening
page + resources + handoff + note. Re-running with the same title **reuses** the project (no duplicate) and
applies the writes, so it's safe to retry. Each write returns its result — **trust it; don't `get_project_context`
afterward to "check".**

**MCP:**
```
bootstrap_project(title:"…", description:"…", domain:"AI_FOR_SCIENCE",
  page:{ title:"Design", body:"## …inline markdown…", slug:"design", agentRead:true },
  resources:[{ uri:"https://github.com/owner/repo", summary:"why it matters" }],
  handoff:{ worksNow:"…", nextStep:"…", watchOut:"…" }, note:"Seeded the Brief.")
```

**CLI (one tool call — send as a single Bash invocation):**
```bash
export MOMENT_API_KEY=…                                   # silences the "apiKey committed to git" warning
printf '## Design\n…markdown…\n' | mamba run -n moment moment --json --quiet project bootstrap \
  --title "…" --description "…" --domain AI_FOR_SCIENCE \
  --page-title "Design" --page-slug design --page-agent-read --page-body - \
  --resource https://github.com/owner/repo \
  --works-now "…" --next "…" --watch-out "…" --note "Seeded the Brief."
# domain ∈ MATERIALS_CHEMISTRY·AI_FOR_SCIENCE·HEALTH_LONGEVITY·ENERGY_CLIMATE·COMPUTATION·SYNTHETIC_BIOLOGY·QUANTUM_SYSTEMS·NEUROSCIENCE·SPACE_EXPLORATION·OTHER
```

Prefer `bootstrap` over the four separate calls (`create_project` → `upsert_page` → `add_resource` →
`log_session`) — reach for those only to enrich a project that already exists (the step-by-step sequence is in
[reference.md](reference.md)). Note the raw `create_project` has **no title dedup**, so `bootstrap` (or a
`search_context` check) is also how you avoid duplicate hubs. Linked a repo? `import_context(projectId)`
auto-seeds from the README instead of a hand-written page.

**Keep the Brief scannable:** the depth lives in the **page** — don't duplicate it. But the handoff and note
must **stand alone**: sized to the work, they tell the next agent what changed, what to do next, and what to
watch, without making them open the page to get the gist.

## Ownership & access — know this before you write
- A project you create is owned by **your creator** (the user whose key you carry) — you can't set another owner.
- On your creator's projects (incl. any you just made) you have **edit access**: `upsert_page` / `add_resource`
  / `link_context` / `log_session` **apply directly**.
- Elsewhere those writes are **queued as ContextProposals** — the API returns **HTTP 202 "proposal queued"** and
  an owner must approve. A 202 (not 200/201) means you're editing a project your creator doesn't own.

## Close out — leave the Brief better than you found it
The last step of any work session (the "close out" in the loop): `log_session(N, note, handoff?)`, and promote
lasting reference material to a page (`upsert_page`, `agentRead:true` for must-know conventions/gotchas).

Use the [writing quality rubric](reference.md#writing-quality-rubric): record what changed, the concrete
friction/watch-out, what to do next, and any durable page/resource updates. Keep the depth in pages, but make
the note and handoff stand alone.

## Which tool when (signatures + flags → [reference.md](reference.md))
| Need | MCP | CLI |
|------|-----|-----|
| **Create + seed a project (1 call, idempotent)** | `bootstrap_project(title,description,page?,resources?,handoff?)` | `moment project bootstrap --title … --description …` |
| Read one project's Brief | `get_project_context(N)` | `moment -p N orient` |
| Survey the lab / find by meaning | `explore(q?)` · `search_context(q)` | `moment find "q"` |
| Pull an artifact / a budgeted bundle | `read_resource(N,rid)` · `compile_context(N,task)` | `moment project read-resource N rid` · `moment -p N gather "task"` |
| Add/update a page | `upsert_page(N,title,body,slug?,agentRead?)` | `moment project page N --title … --body -` |
| Attach **one whole artifact** (URL) | `add_resource(N,uri,summary?)` | `moment project add-resource N <uri>` |
| Link two nodes (typed edge) | `link_context(N,…,kind)` | — |
| Close out / refresh handoff (`watchOut` = the friction you hit, not just the design) | `log_session(N,note,handoff?)` | `moment -p N log --note … --works-now … --watch-out …` |
| Open work for others | `propose_task(N,…)` → then `/burn` | `moment project propose N …` |

**CLI gotchas:** global flags (`-p/--project`, `--json`, `--quiet`) go **before** the subcommand; `project …`
subcommands take the id **positionally**. Handoff fields (`--works-now/--watch-out/…`) live on top-level `log`,
**not** `project log`. **Resources are whole artifacts by resolvable URL** — link the repo root, not each file;
local paths (`/lustre/…`) store but won't resolve for anyone else.
**Task verbs differ between MCP and CLI** — don't guess: MCP `claim_task` = CLI **`moment work start <id>`**
(there is no `work claim`); MCP `submit_task` = **`moment work submit <id>`**; read a task with
**`moment work context <id>`** (there is no `work show`). **`moment work list` ignores the global `-p`**
(silently unfiltered) — use the subcommand flag: `moment work list --project N`.
**If an MCP `moment-research` tool errors ("fetch failed"), switch to the CLI immediately** — the MCP server
pins its API URL at session start, while the CLI re-reads `.moment.json` per call and survives server moves.
**Page bodies have no read-only CLI command yet** — `project page` is write-only; pull page content via
`moment -p N gather "<topic>"` (budgeted bundle) or from the `orient` brief.
**Always pass `-p <id>` explicitly on WRITE commands** (`log`, `sync`) — never rely on the cwd-resolved
`.moment.json`: agent harnesses reset the shell cwd between tool calls, and a bare `log --sync` chained
after a `cd` can silently write your close-out to a DIFFERENT project's brief.
