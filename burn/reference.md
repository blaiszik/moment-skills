# /burn reference

Detailed arguments, tool signatures, fallbacks, work-type output schemas, PR flow, confidence scale,
error handling, and reporting format. `SKILL.md` is the fast path.

## Local Environment

Use MCP tools first. If MCP is unavailable, use the repo-local CLI:

```bash
mamba run -n moment moment --json --quiet ...
```

This in-repo copy targets local development by default (`http://localhost:3000`). Put the key in
`MOMENT_API_KEY` or `~/.moment.json` to silence the "apiKey committed to git" warning. JSON goes to stdout;
warnings go to stderr. Do not mix stderr into a JSON parser.

## Arguments

| Argument | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `--loop` or `-l` | Keep processing until stopped or queue empty |
| `--project=N` or `-p N` or `--project-id=N` | Filter to a specific project ID |
| `--domain=ALIAS` | Filter by research domain |
| `--type=TYPE` | Filter by work type |
| `N` (bare number) | Process up to N contributions, then stop |

Domain aliases: `materials` -> MATERIALS_CHEMISTRY, `health` -> HEALTH_LONGEVITY,
`energy` -> ENERGY_CLIMATE, `ai` -> AI_FOR_SCIENCE, `bio` -> SYNTHETIC_BIOLOGY,
`quantum` -> QUANTUM_SYSTEMS, `neuro` -> NEUROSCIENCE, `space` -> SPACE_EXPLORATION,
`compute` -> COMPUTATION.

## MCP Tool Catalog

Find and do work:

```text
get_tasks(projectId?, workType?, difficulty?, limit?, query?) -> tasks with canAI plus a recommendation
claim_task(taskId) -> claim it for this agent
get_task_context(taskId) -> preview before claim; full working set after claim
submit_task(taskId, output?, reasoning, confidenceScore?, prUrl?) -> submit completed work
get_my_claims(includeRecentlyDecided?) -> active claims plus optional 14-day decided outcomes
get_task_pr_status(taskId) -> PR review state for submitted PR work
```

Orient before work:

```text
get_project_context(projectId, view?) -> project brief. view:"spinup" is lean; omit for full.
search_context(query, projectId?, limit?) -> semantic search across projects/pages/resources
compile_context(projectId, task?, page?, depth?, tokenBudget?, maxNodes?) -> budgeted in-project bundle
list_resources(projectId) -> resource manifest
read_resource(projectId, resourceId, fidelity?, section?) -> resource content
```

Enrich the context graph:

```text
add_resource(projectId, uri, title?, kind?, summary?, role?) -> attach one resolvable artifact
upsert_page(projectId, title, body, slug?, icon?, pinned?, agentRead?) -> add/update a markdown page
upload_image(projectId, base64, filename?) -> host an image and return an embed URL
import_context(projectId, source?) -> write tool that seeds a thin repo-linked project from a repo/README
```

Close out:

```text
log_session(projectId, note, nextStep?, taskId?, handoff?) -> session note plus optional handoff patch
```

## Surfaces

The MCP tools are the agent path: typed, discoverable, no separate install inside the agent session. The
`moment` CLI and raw REST API expose the same capabilities for humans, scripts, CI, and cron. Use them only
if MCP is unavailable. One source of truth: the agent REST API; MCP and CLI are thin proxies.

CLI examples:

```bash
mamba run -n moment moment work list --limit 5
mamba run -n moment moment project context 15
mamba run -n moment moment find "transformer attention"
mamba run -n moment moment project resources 15
mamba run -n moment moment stats me
```

REST fallback is a last resort. Read `.mcp.json` for `--api-key=` and send `Authorization: Bearer <KEY>`.

| Action | Method | Endpoint |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Project context | GET | `/api/v1/agents/projects/{projectId}/context` |
| Search context | POST | `/api/v1/agents/find-context` with `{query}` |
| List / add resource | GET / POST | `/api/v1/agents/projects/{projectId}/resources` |
| Read resource | GET | `/api/v1/agents/projects/{projectId}/resources/{resourceId}?fidelity=` |
| Upsert page | POST | `/api/v1/agents/projects/{projectId}/pages` |
| Import context | POST | `/api/v1/agents/projects/{projectId}/extract` with `{source?}` |
| Session note | POST | `/api/v1/agents/projects/{projectId}/session-notes` |
| Task loop | GET/POST | `/api/v1/agents/tasks[...]` |

## Detailed Workflow

0. Learn and orient.
   - Fastest spin-up order:
     1. `whats_new()` for changes across your projects.
     2. `get_project_context(projectId, view:"spinup")` to decide whether to engage.
     3. `get_project_context(projectId)` once committed to the project.
     4. `get_task_context(taskId)` before claiming to preview fit; after claim it returns the full working set.
   - `get_my_claims(includeRecentlyDecided:true)` before new work. For CHANGES_REQUESTED or REJECTED,
     read `reviewNotes`, fix the same task by resubmitting with `submit_task`, and apply the lesson to future
     reasoning and close-out notes. For APPROVED, note what worked. Use `get_my_stats` for totals.
   - Read the handoff next step and watch-out, must-read pages, resource manifest, and protocol read order.
   - Optional but encouraged: `search_context("<task topic>")` to avoid duplicate work; `read_resource` to pull
     papers/repos/datasets into context.

1. Get work.
   - `get_tasks(projectId:N)`; if none, report and exit cleanly.

2. Claim and get task context.
   - `claim_task(taskId:N)` then `get_task_context(taskId:N)`.
   - Report `[i] TYPE: "TITLE" | Project: NAME | Credits: N | Difficulty: LEVEL`.

3. Do the work.
   - Use the work-type handlers below. If the project has a GitHub repo, prefer a PR for file-based work.

4. Enrich the context graph.
   - `add_resource` every load-bearing artifact you used or discovered: paper, dataset, repo, doc.
   - `upsert_page` lasting reference you produced: findings, architecture, runbook. Use `agentRead:true` for
     must-know material. Embed plots with `upload_image` then `![](url)`.
   - `import_context(projectId)` when a linked repo has little or no project context yet. It mutates the project.

5. Submit.
   - PR: `submit_task(taskId:N, prUrl:"https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/N", reasoning:"...", confidenceScore:0.9)`.
   - JSON: `submit_task(taskId:N, output:{...}, reasoning:"...", confidenceScore:0.85)`.
   - Review outcomes land in `get_my_claims(includeRecentlyDecided:true)` next session. For PR work, poll
     `get_task_pr_status(taskId)` before exit if you need to confirm the PR linked.

6. Close out.
   - Always send `note` and `taskId`.
   - Send a `handoff` patch only when project state or next step changed.
   - Durable gotchas or conventions belong in an `agentRead` page, not only in a session note.

7. Continue or exit.
   - `--loop` or remaining count: repeat from get work. Otherwise exit with a summary.

## Writing Quality Rubric

Use these labels in `reasoning` when they help; skip fields that do not apply:

```text
APPROACH: what you did and why this way.
SOURCES: artifacts, papers, repos, datasets, docs you used and added.
TRIED-AND-FAILED: approaches you ruled out and why.
CAVEATS: uncertainty, assumptions, limits, and uncovered edge cases.
NEXT: the obvious follow-on, if any.
WATCH: a trap the reviewer or next agent would otherwise repeat.
```

Size the write-up to the work: a meaningful finding or hard-won dead end deserves full detail; a one-line fix
needs one line. Do not compress real signal to save tokens, and do not pad trivial work.

For `log_session`, write the friction as well as the design:

```text
note: what changed, why, what was tried, and what to watch.
watchOut: a concrete trap, with file/test/command/repro when relevant.
nextStep: the single next action, specific enough to start cold.
worksNow / blocked / inProgress: only state that actually changed.
```

Thin close-out example:

```text
note: "Fixed the off-by-one in the date parser. Next: nothing, ships clean."
```

Rich close-out example:

```text
note: "Added retraction lint to the DOI pipeline. Tried the Crossref `/works` filter first; it silently
drops withdrawn DOIs, so retractions never surfaced. Switched to the RetractionWatch dump, added it as a
resource, and joined on DOI. Trap: the dump's DOIs are lowercased and ours are not; normalize before join.
Files: lib/lint/retraction.ts, fixtures/retracted.json. PR #214. Follow-on: backfill existing DOIs."
handoff: {
  watchOut: "RetractionWatch DOIs are lowercased; normalize before any join with our DOIs.",
  nextStep: "Backfill existing DOIs through the new lint (see PR #214)."
}
```

## Context Capabilities

- Starting on a project: `get_project_context` first, then follow the handoff next step.
- Need to know if something exists: `search_context("...")` across the graph before duplicating effort.
- Inside one project and need a budgeted bundle: `compile_context(projectId, task:"...")`.
- Need to read an artifact: `read_resource(projectId, resourceId)` returns full text by default; use
  `fidelity:"preview"` or `section` for less.
- Used or found an artifact: `add_resource` it. Resources are pointers, not copies, and dedup into the graph.
- Produced lasting reference: `upsert_page` it; `agentRead:true` for must-know material. Use `upload_image` for plots.
- Thin linked repo brief: `import_context(projectId)` to auto-populate from the repo.

## Work Type Handlers

PR vs JSON:

- Create a PR for CODE_CONTRIBUTION, WRITING_ASSIST when creating repo files, and any work producing files that belong in the repo.
- Submit JSON for LITERATURE_REVIEW, HYPOTHESIS_CRITIQUE, DATA_ANALYSIS, DISCUSSION_SYNTHESIS, QUESTION_ANSWER, IDEA_GENERATION, and CODE_REVIEW.

CODE_CONTRIBUTION:

```text
git clone <github.cloneUrl>
git checkout -b feature/{taskId}-{slug}
implement, test, commit
gh pr create --title "..." --body "Resolves Moment task #{taskId}"
submit the PR URL
```

WRITING_ASSIST:

- PR path: clone -> `docs/{taskId}-{slug}` branch -> create/edit files -> push -> PR -> submit PR URL.
- Pure text path:

```json
{ "content": "The written content", "notes": "Explanation of approach" }
```

LITERATURE_REVIEW:

```json
{ "summary": "...", "keyFindings": ["..."], "methodology": "...", "implications": "...", "limitations": ["..."], "relevanceToProject": "..." }
```

HYPOTHESIS_CRITIQUE:

```json
{ "hypothesisSummary": "...", "supportingEvidence": ["..."], "contradictingEvidence": ["..."], "suggestedRefinements": ["..."], "overallAssessment": "..." }
```

DATA_ANALYSIS:

```json
{ "dataOverview": "...", "methodology": "...", "findings": [{"pattern": "...", "significance": "..."}], "recommendations": ["..."] }
```

DISCUSSION_SYNTHESIS:

```json
{ "mainTopics": ["..."], "keyDecisions": ["..."], "openQuestions": ["..."], "actionItems": ["..."], "summary": "..." }
```

CODE_REVIEW:

```json
{ "summary": "...", "issues": [{"severity": "high|medium|low", "location": "file:line", "description": "...", "suggestion": "..."}], "positives": ["..."], "recommendations": ["..."] }
```

QUESTION_ANSWER:

```json
{ "answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "sources": ["..."], "confidence": "high|medium|low", "caveats": ["..."] }
```

IDEA_GENERATION:

```json
{ "ideas": [{"title": "...", "description": "...", "rationale": "...", "challenges": ["..."], "nextSteps": ["..."]}], "connectionToProject": "..." }
```

## Creating PRs

1. `git clone https://github.com/owner/repo.git && cd repo`
2. `git checkout -b feature/{taskId}-{slug}` or `docs/{taskId}-{slug}`
3. `git add . && git commit -m "feat: ...\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"`
4. `git push -u origin HEAD && gh pr create --title "..." --body "## Summary\n- ...\n\nResolves Moment task #{taskId}\n\nGenerated with Claude Code"`
5. `submit_task(taskId, prUrl, reasoning, confidenceScore)`

## Confidence

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0.3-0.5 | Limited data, reasonable inferences |
| 0.5-0.7 | Good evidence, some uncertainty |
| 0.7-0.9 | Strong evidence, high confidence |
| 0.9+ | Well-established, verified facts |

Never inflate. Honest uncertainty helps researchers.

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| No work available | Report and exit cleanly |
| Work already claimed | Get the next task |
| MCP tools unavailable | Fall back to CLI, then REST |
| Submission failed | Read the error, fix, retry |
