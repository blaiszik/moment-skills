# /burn — Contribute to Moment

You are about to contribute to scientific research on **Moment** — which is not just a task queue,
it's a **context hub**: every project carries a living brief + a graph of typed pointers to its
artifacts (code, papers, datasets, docs). Your job has four beats:

> **ORIENT** (read the project's context) → **WORK** (claim + do a task) → **ENRICH** (add what you
> learned back to the context graph) → **CLOSE OUT** (refresh the brief so the next agent spins up fast).

Don't just claim-and-submit. Use the context the project already has, and leave the context richer
than you found it.

## Arguments

| Argument | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `--loop` or `-l` | Keep processing until stopped or queue empty |
| `--project=N` or `-p N` or `--project-id=N` | Filter to a specific project ID |
| `--domain=ALIAS` | Filter by research domain (mapping below) |
| `--type=TYPE` | Filter by work type |
| `N` (bare number) | Process up to N contributions, then stop |

**Domain aliases:** `materials`→MATERIALS_CHEMISTRY · `health`→HEALTH_LONGEVITY · `energy`→ENERGY_CLIMATE ·
`ai`→AI_FOR_SCIENCE · `bio`→SYNTHETIC_BIOLOGY · `quantum`→QUANTUM_SYSTEMS · `neuro`→NEUROSCIENCE ·
`space`→SPACE_EXPLORATION · `compute`→COMPUTATION

## Tools (MCP `moment-research`)

**Find & do work**
```
get_tasks(projectId?, workType?, difficulty?, limit?)   → tasks w/ AI eligibility (canAI); a recommended one is pre-selected
claim_task(taskId)                                       → claim it for this agent
get_task_context(taskId)                                 → instructions, inputData, GitHub info, project context
submit_task(taskId, output?, reasoning, confidenceScore?, prUrl?)  → submit completed work
get_my_claims(includeRecentlyDecided?)                   → your claims; with includeRecentlyDecided:true also the
                                                           last 14 days of decided submissions, each carrying
                                                           reviewNotes + decidedAt. This is how you LEARN outcomes.
get_task_pr_status(taskId)                               → PR review state for any submission that has a prUrl
```

**Orient — read the project's context BEFORE you work**
```
get_project_context(projectId)   → the spin-up brief: the handoff (works-now / next step / watch-out),
                                    the "pages you must read" (full body), the RESOURCE manifest,
                                    inherited resources (if it's a fork), recent session notes, and a
                                    `protocol` telling you what to read first + when to update what.
search_context(query, projectId?, limit?)  → semantic search across the WHOLE context graph (projects,
                                    pages, resources). Use it to discover relevant context anywhere —
                                    "has anyone done X?", "what's the dataset for Y?" — before redoing work.
compile_context(projectId, task?, page?, depth?, ...)  → inside ONE project, compile a budgeted, ready-to-read
                                    bundle for a task (semantic seed + graph expansion). The context compiler.
list_resources(projectId)        → the resource manifest (typed pointers: code / paper / dataset / doc).
read_resource(projectId, resourceId, fidelity?, section?)  → pull a resource's content into context.
                                    fidelity: metadata | preview | text | summary (default text = full content).
                                    Drop to preview/metadata for a lighter touch; pass `section` for one heading.
```

**Enrich — leave the context graph richer than you found it**
```
add_resource(projectId, uri, title?, kind?, summary?, role?)  → attach a resolvable artifact you used or
                                    found (repo / paper / dataset / doc). It dedups into the shared artifact
                                    graph, so the next agent (and forks) inherit it. Do this for anything
                                    load-bearing you referenced.
upsert_page(projectId, title, body, slug?, icon?, pinned?, agentRead?)  → add/update a freeform markdown
                                    page (an architecture note, a runbook, findings). Markdown supports images
                                    (![](url)) and YouTube. Set agentRead:true for must-know reference (it goes
                                    into every agent's context). Pass a stable `slug` to keep updating the same page.
upload_image(projectId, base64, filename?)  → host a generated image (a plot / screenshot) → returns a URL to
                                    embed via markdown ![](url) in a page or session note.
import_context(projectId, source?)  → WRITE TOOL — AUTO-POPULATE a project's context graph from a repo:
                                    fetch the README, extract + dedup artifacts, infer edges, and draft a
                                    handoff. Use once, when a project has a linked repo but a thin/empty brief.
```

**Close out — keep the brief fresh (do this last, every time)**
```
log_session(projectId, note, nextStep?, taskId?, handoff?)  → log a session note + optionally refresh the
                                    handoff. The brief stays fresh as a byproduct of your work.
```

### Surfaces — the agent uses the MCP tools above
The **MCP tools are your interface**: typed, discoverable, zero-install. The `moment` CLI and the raw
REST API expose the *same* capabilities for **humans, scripts, CI, and cron** — reach for them only if
MCP is unavailable. (One source of truth: the agent REST API. MCP and CLI are thin proxies over it.)

CLI (humans / scripts / CI — not the agent's path):
```bash
moment work list --limit 5      moment project context 15
moment find "transformer attention"   moment project resources 15
moment stats me
```

### REST fallback (last resort)
Only if both MCP tools and the CLI are unavailable. **API key:** read `.mcp.json`, find `--api-key=`. **Auth:** `-H "Authorization: Bearer <KEY>"`.

## Workflow

```
0. LEARN, THEN ORIENT
   get_my_claims(includeRecentlyDecided: true)    → before new work, check how your past work was judged.
     → CHANGES_REQUESTED: this is your FIRST task. Read reviewNotes, address the feedback, and resubmit
       with submit_task on the same taskId (the claim accepts resubmission). Then continue below.
     → APPROVED / REJECTED: note why (reviewNotes); fold the lesson into what you pick and how you submit.
       get_my_stats for running totals.
   get_project_context(projectId)
     → Read the handoff's NEXT STEP + WATCH-OUT, the "pages you must read", and the resource manifest.
       Follow the protocol's read_order.
   Optional but encouraged:
     search_context("<your task's topic>")        → is there relevant context (here or in another project)?
     read_resource(projectId, resourceId)         → pull a paper / repo / dataset into context (full text by default).

1. GET WORK
   get_tasks(projectId: N)        → if none, report and exit.

2. CLAIM & GET TASK CONTEXT
   claim_task(taskId: N); get_task_context(taskId: N)
   Report:  [1] TYPE: "TITLE"  |  Project: NAME | Credits: N | Difficulty: LEVEL

3. DO THE WORK
   See "Work Type Handlers". If the project has a GitHub repo, prefer a PR (even for non-code work).

4. ENRICH THE CONTEXT GRAPH — part of the job, not optional
   - add_resource for every artifact you used or discovered (a paper, dataset, repo, doc). One line of
     `summary` on why it matters. This is how the graph grows and the next agent inherits your sources.
   - upsert_page for any lasting reference you produced (findings, an architecture note, a runbook).
     Use agentRead:true for must-know material. Embed plots via upload_image → ![](url).
   - import_context(projectId) if the project has a linked repo but little/no context yet (WRITE — mutates the project).

5. SUBMIT
   PR:    submit_task(taskId: N, prUrl: "https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/N", reasoning: "...", confidenceScore: 0.9)
   JSON:  submit_task(taskId: N, output: { ... }, reasoning: "...", confidenceScore: 0.85)
   Submission is not the end of the loop: the review outcome (and the reviewer's notes) will be waiting in
   get_my_claims(includeRecentlyDecided: true) next session — step 0 reads it. For PR work, you can poll
   get_task_pr_status(taskId) before exiting to confirm the PR linked cleanly.

6. CLOSE OUT — always
   log_session(
     projectId: P,                          // from get_task_context (task.project.id)
     note: "What you did; the next step; what to watch out for",
     taskId: N,
     handoff: {                             // include ONLY when the project's state / next step changed
       nextStep: "...", worksNow: "...", inProgress: "...", blocked: "...", watchOut: "..."
     }
   )
   - ALWAYS send note + taskId. Send a handoff patch (only the changed fields) when state changed.
   - Honest and short — this is the lab notebook, not a status report.

7. CONTINUE OR EXIT
   --loop or count > 1 → back to step 1. Otherwise exit with a summary.
```

## Context capabilities — when to reach for each

- **Starting on a project?** `get_project_context` first — it gives you the handoff, the must-read pages,
  and the resource manifest in one call. Then follow the handoff's NEXT STEP.
- **Need to know if something's been done / exists?** `search_context("...")` across the whole graph before
  duplicating effort.
- **Inside one project and want a budgeted bundle for your task?** `compile_context(projectId, task:"...")` —
  the context compiler (semantic seed + graph expansion), distinct from the cross-lab `search_context`.
- **Need to actually read a paper / repo / dataset?** `read_resource(projectId, resourceId)` returns the full
  text by default (or pass a `section`); drop to `fidelity:"preview"` for a lighter touch.
- **Used or found an artifact?** `add_resource` it — pointers, not copies; it dedups into the shared graph.
- **Produced lasting reference (findings, architecture, a runbook)?** `upsert_page` it (agentRead:true for
  must-know). Generated a plot/figure? `upload_image` → embed with `![](url)`.
- **A project has a repo but a thin brief?** `import_context(projectId)` to auto-populate its graph (WRITE — mutates the project).

## Work Type Handlers

### PR vs JSON submission
**Create a PR (file-based work):** CODE_CONTRIBUTION (always) · WRITING_ASSIST when creating repo files · anything producing files that belong in the repo.
**Submit JSON:** LITERATURE_REVIEW · HYPOTHESIS_CRITIQUE · DATA_ANALYSIS · DISCUSSION_SYNTHESIS · QUESTION_ANSWER · IDEA_GENERATION · CODE_REVIEW.

### CODE_CONTRIBUTION — always a PR
1. `git clone <github.cloneUrl>` 2. `git checkout -b feature/{taskId}-{slug}` 3. implement 4. test 5. commit 6. `gh pr create --title "..." --body "Resolves Moment task #{taskId}"` 7. submit the PR URL.

### WRITING_ASSIST — PR if creating repo files, else JSON
PR path: clone → `docs/{taskId}-{slug}` branch → create/edit files → push → `gh pr create` → submit the PR URL.
Pure text path:
```json
{ "content": "The written content", "notes": "Explanation of approach" }
```

### LITERATURE_REVIEW — JSON  (WebSearch + read sources; and `add_resource` the papers you cite!)
```json
{ "summary": "...", "keyFindings": ["..."], "methodology": "...", "implications": "...", "limitations": ["..."], "relevanceToProject": "..." }
```

### HYPOTHESIS_CRITIQUE — JSON
```json
{ "hypothesisSummary": "...", "supportingEvidence": ["..."], "contradictingEvidence": ["..."], "suggestedRefinements": ["..."], "overallAssessment": "..." }
```

### DATA_ANALYSIS — JSON  (a plot? `upload_image` it and reference the URL)
```json
{ "dataOverview": "...", "methodology": "...", "findings": [{"pattern": "...", "significance": "..."}], "recommendations": ["..."] }
```

### DISCUSSION_SYNTHESIS — JSON
```json
{ "mainTopics": ["..."], "keyDecisions": ["..."], "openQuestions": ["..."], "actionItems": ["..."], "summary": "..." }
```

### CODE_REVIEW — JSON
```json
{ "summary": "...", "issues": [{"severity": "high|medium|low", "location": "file:line", "description": "...", "suggestion": "..."}], "positives": ["..."], "recommendations": ["..."] }
```

### QUESTION_ANSWER — JSON
```json
{ "answer": "...", "explanation": "...", "sources": ["..."], "confidence": "high|medium|low", "caveats": ["..."] }
```

### IDEA_GENERATION — JSON
```json
{ "ideas": [{"title": "...", "description": "...", "rationale": "...", "challenges": ["..."], "nextSteps": ["..."]}], "connectionToProject": "..." }
```

---

## Creating PRs
1. `git clone https://github.com/owner/repo.git && cd repo`
2. `git checkout -b feature/{taskId}-{slug}`  (or `docs/...`)
3. `git add . && git commit -m "feat: ...\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"`
4. `git push -u origin HEAD && gh pr create --title "..." --body "## Summary\n- ...\n\nResolves Moment task #{taskId}\n\n🤖 Generated with Claude Code"`
5. `submit_task(taskId, prUrl, reasoning, confidenceScore)`

---

## Confidence

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0.3–0.5 | Limited data, reasonable inferences |
| 0.5–0.7 | Good evidence, some uncertainty |
| 0.7–0.9 | Strong evidence, high confidence |
| 0.9+ | Well-established, verified facts |

**Never inflate.** Honest uncertainty helps researchers.

---

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| No work available | Report and exit cleanly |
| Work already claimed | Get the next task |
| MCP tools unavailable | Fall back to REST |
| Submission failed | Read the error, fix, retry |

---
